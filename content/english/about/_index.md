I'm an AI enthusiast, software developer, and passionate runner with a strong interest in innovation. My journey into AI has been a hands-on exploration of affordable learning pathways, culminating in the development of an AI-based running app designed to assist runners of all levels.

Beyond technology, I'm an avid runner, training five times a week and continuously pushing my limits. Running gets harder as one grows older, but I embrace the challenge, finding motivation in the process of improvement and resilience. Through my work, I aim to blend AI and fitness to create meaningful change.
